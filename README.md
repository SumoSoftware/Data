# Data

.NetStandard Database Library and Simple ORM
--------------------------------------------

We originally wrote this system to simplify access to data in SQL Server way back before Entity Framework was released.
The original code was in VB.Net. This is a complete rewrite in C# targeting .NetStandard 2.0. 

We're experimenting with some code-first features in the Sqlite library. For SQL Server there's a code generator for stored procedure parameter context classes that builds the C# code from the SQL Server stored procedure meta data.

# Sqlite - not stable - don't use
